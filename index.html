    <h3>What are my Weingarten Rights?</h3>
    <p><p>
  You have the right to union representation during any meeting that could lead to discipline. If you’re called into a meeting with management and believe it might result in discipline or affect your working conditions, you must clearly state:
</p>

<p><em>“If this meeting could lead to discipline or affect my employment, I request my union steward be present.”</em></p>

<p>
  Management is not required to inform you of this right — you must invoke it. Once you do, they must either:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stop the meeting until your steward arrives</li>
  <li>End the meeting</li>
  <li>Give you the choice to continue without representation (not recommended)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Never attend a disciplinary meeting alone — always ask for your steward.

  <div class="qa-item">
    <h3>How do I contact my steward?</h3>
    <p>Just select your campus from the dropdown menu above. Your stewards' emails will appear instantly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-item">
    <h3>Is everything I tell my steward confidential?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Union stewards are trained to keep your information confidential and will not share anything without your permission unless you’re at immediate risk.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-item">
    <h3>What if my manager says I don’t need a steward?</h3>
    <p>It’s not their decision. If you ask for a steward, they are required by law to pause the meeting until one is present. Don’t let them pressure you into proceeding alone.</p>
  </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
    <h3>What if no steward is available right away?</h3>
    <p>Politely state that you are invoking your Weingarten Rights and cannot proceed without union representation. Contact union leadership so they can assign a backup steward if needed.</p>
  </div>
    <div class="qa-item">
    <h3>Can I become a steward or get more involved?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely. We’re always looking for more advocates. Talk to your current steward or a committee lead about how to get started.</p>
