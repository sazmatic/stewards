      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="qa-item">
  <h3>What are my Weingarten Rights?</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right to union representation during any meeting that could lead to discipline.
    If you‚Äôre called into a meeting with management and believe it might result in discipline or affect your working conditions,
    you must clearly state:
  </p>
  <p style="margin: 12px 0; font-style: italic;">
    ‚ÄúIf this meeting could lead to discipline or affect my employment, I request my union steward be present.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top: 18px;">
    Management is not required to inform you of this right ‚Äî you must invoke it. Once you do, they must either:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin: 12px 0 18px 20px; padding-left: 0; text-align: left;">
    <li>Stop the meeting until your steward arrives</li>
    <li>End the meeting</li>
    <li>Give you the choice to continue without representation (not recommended)</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
    Never attend a disciplinary meeting alone ‚Äî always ask for your steward.
  </p>

      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>Who are the union stewards?</h3>
        <p>They‚Äôre dedicated nurses and RN APPs who‚Äôve volunteered to serve as Local 2024 stewards. They were appointed by Trustee Mike Smith to help lead and support us during this first critical chapter of our union.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>Are these permanent positions?</h3>
        <p>No. These roles are currently appointed, but will eventually become elected positions once our contract is ratified and our bylaws are in place.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>What do stewards do?</h3>
        <p>Stewards serve as a direct support system for nurses, representing their coworkers, helping communicate important updates across campuses, and making sure everyone stays informed and connected. They play a critical role in building our union from the ground up‚Äîbridging gaps, advocating for staff, and laying the foundation for a strong, united front as we move toward our first contract.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>How are stewards assigned?</h3>
        <p>Stewards are listed by campus, not by individual units. That means you may not have someone on your exact floor, but any steward at your campus is there to help.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>What if my unit or service doesn‚Äôt have a steward?</h3>
        <p>You‚Äôre still supported. Any steward at your location can assist you, ensuring no one is left out or uninformed.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>Is everything I tell my steward confidential?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Union stewards are trained to keep your information confidential and will not share anything without your permission unless you‚Äôre at immediate risk.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>What if my manager says I don‚Äôt need a steward?</h3>
        <p>It‚Äôs not their decision. If you ask for a steward, they are required by law to pause the meeting until one is present. Don‚Äôt let them pressure you into proceeding alone.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>Can I become a steward or get more involved?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. We‚Äôre always looking for more advocates. Talk to your current steward or a Local 2024 representative about how to get started.</p>
      </div>
      
       <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>Why is this steward system so important right now?</h3>
        <p>Because we‚Äôre just getting started. These stewards are helping us stay connected, informed, and empowered as we move toward securing our first union contract.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>How do I report a violation or file an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP)?</h3>
        <p>
          If you believe your right to union representation was denied or your ability to participate in protected union activity was interfered with, 
          you may be eligible to file an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP).
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 16px;">
          A union steward will guide you through the process, ensure the situation is reviewed, and assist you with filing if necessary.
