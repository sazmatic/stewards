  <h3>What are my Weingarten Rights?</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right to union representation during any meeting that could lead to discipline.
    If you’re called into a meeting with management and believe it might result in discipline or affect your working conditions,
    you must clearly state:
  </p>
  <p style="margin: 12px 0; font-style: italic;">
    “If this meeting could lead to discipline or affect my employment, I request my union steward be present.”
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top: 18px;">
    Management is not required to inform you of this right — you must invoke it. Once you do, they must either:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin: 12px 0 18px 20px; padding-left: 0; text-align: left;">
    <li>Stop the meeting until your steward arrives</li>
    <li>End the meeting</li>
    <li>Give you the choice to continue without representation (not recommended)</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
    Never attend a disciplinary meeting alone — always ask for your steward.
  </p>

        <h3>Who are the union stewards?</h3>
        <p>They’re dedicated nurses and RN APPs who’ve volunteered to serve as Local 2024 stewards. They were appointed by Trustee Mike Smith to help lead and support us during this first critical chapter of our union.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>Are these permanent positions?</h3>
        <p>No. These roles are currently appointed, but will eventually become elected positions once our contract is finalized and our bylaws are in place.</p>

        <h3>What do stewards do?</h3>
        <p>✔️ They represent and support their coworkers
✔️ They help share important updates with all 10,000 nurses across campuses
✔️ They’re laying the foundation for a strong, united union</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>Is everything I tell my steward confidential?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Union stewards are trained to keep your information confidential and will not share anything without your permission unless you’re at immediate risk.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>What if my manager says I don’t need a steward?</h3>
        <p>It’s not their decision. If you ask for a steward, they are required by law to pause the meeting until one is present. Don’t let them pressure you into proceeding alone.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>What if no steward is available right away?</h3>
        <p>Politely state that you are invoking your Weingarten Rights and cannot proceed without union representation. Contact union leadership so they can assign a backup steward if needed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>Can I become a steward or get more involved?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. We’re always looking for more advocates. Talk to your current steward or a committee lead about how to get started.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>How do I report a violation or file an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP)?</h3>
        <p>
          If you believe your right to union representation was denied or your ability to participate in protected union activity was interfered with, 
          you may be eligible to file an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP).
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 16px;">
          A union steward will guide you through the process, ensure the situation is reviewed, and assist you with filing if necessary.
